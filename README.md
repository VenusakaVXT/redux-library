# What is Redux Library?
The Redux library in Javascript is an application state management library. It is used to store and manage the state of the application in an easy and understandable way.

# Project idea
I have consulted the redux library [here](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) and used TypeScript language to write it.

<div style="background-color: #f2f2f2; border-left: 4px solid #333; padding: 10px;">
    <p><strong>In order for the browser to execute TS code, we must compile from TS to JS.</p>
</div>

# Using the Redux Library
Open Terminal at the project root directory.

Install the TypeScript environment.
```  ```

# Overview of Redux Library
Redux helps to separate application state and processing logic. It works based on the Flux model, with a single store to store the state and actions to change that state.

*Flux Model.*

This is a data flow model that emulates the Redux library:

*Simulate how Redux works on ATM deposit/withdrawal application.*

Based on the above model, I also coded the redux library myself with the same operation and built the redux-based application like the picture above but it is a Money Saving Piggy application :)))

# Results Obtained
I built the UI and it works like below.
